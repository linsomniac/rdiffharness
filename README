==========================================

Backup system that uses rdiff to store history.  The backup server connects
to the clients, so SSH keys are stored on the server.  It can ping the
clients and retry for a specified number of hours, waiting for the client
to become available.

The benefit is that it is just a single, fairly simple but robust, script.
It uses rsync to talk to the client, and then rdiff-backup to do the
historic deltas.

One caveat: because of the way rdiff-backup responds to being disconnected
in the middle of a backup, and because Fedora, CentOS, and Ubuntu provide
different, incompatible versions of rdiffbackup, this stores multiple
copies of your backup data.  If you are space-constrained, or just can't
live with this, don't look any further.  However, with cheap disc drives,
this mechanism overcomes all the issues I've run into with rdiff-backup in
the past.  *BUT*, you do have to keep 3 copies of all system backups
(current, daily snapshots, monthly snapshots).  Unfortunately, you can't
hardlink these either, because rdiffbackup will break the links.
